 o Purpose: Explanation of error monitor plots in OpenFresco Express

Displacement Error:
===================
This plot tracks the error between the measured and command displacements
over time. A positive error means the measured displacements are greater
than the corresponding command values.

Fourier Amplitude:
==================
Indicates the values of the fourier amplitude of the error for frequencies
from 0 to 100 Hz. This information can be used to identify the dominant
frequencies in the error signal.

Measured vs. Command Displacement:
==================================
This plot compares the measured and command displacements. A straight line
at 45 degrees shows perfect tracking. A line at less than 45 degrees means
the response is undershooting, while a line at more than 45 degrees means
the response is overshooting. If the plot traces out an ellipse counter-
clockwise, the response is lagging behind the command values. Similarly,
a clockwise ellipse indicates a leading response. A counter-clockwise
ellipse at an angle under 45 degrees, indicating both lag and undershoot,
is a common response.

Tracking Indicator:
===================
The tracking indicator is computed as the area underneath the plot of
measured vs. command displacement. A positive plot indicates added damping
in the system, and a negative plot means less damping. Caution should be
taken when the response is negative, as the system can become unstable.
Meanwhile, an increasing line shows the response is leading, while a
decreasing line shows lag. A steeper line in this figure corresponds to a
larger error.
