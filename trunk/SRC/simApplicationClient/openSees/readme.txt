As of OpenFresco Version 2.5 the generic OpenSees elements used to interface
with the OpenFresco simulation application client have been moved to the OpenSees
repository. They are no longer maintained here.

Please obtain the latest changes to those files from the OpenSees repository
using CVS or browse the source code of those files at the following address:
http://opensees.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb2.cgi/OpenSees/SRC/element/generic/

The genericClient commands are now directly available through the OpenSees
TCL-interpreter and are therefore no longer provided in the OpenFresco.dll.
