As of OpenFresco Version 2.6 the adapter OpenSees elements used to interface
with the OpenFresco SimFEAdapter experimental control have been moved to the
OpenSees repository. They are no longer maintained here.

Please obtain the latest changes to those files from the OpenSees repository
using CVS or browse the source code of those files at the following address:
http://opensees.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb2.cgi/OpenSees/SRC/element/adapter/

The adapter and actuator commands are now directly available through the
OpenSees TCL-interpreter and are therefore no longer provided in the
OpenFresco.dll.
